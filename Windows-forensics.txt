1. Windows Registry
Windows Registry is a collection of databases that contains the system's configuration data.
This configuration data can be about the hardware, the software, or the user's information.
It also includes data about the recently used files, programs used, or devices connected to 
the system. As you can understand, this data is beneficial from a forensics standpoint.

In this lesson, we will learn ways to read this data to identify the required using regedit.exe, 
a built-in Windows utility to view and edit the registry. We'll explore other tools to learn about the
registry in the upcoming tasks.

Windows registry consists of Keys and Values. When u open the regedit.exe utility to view the registry, 
the folders you see are Registry Keys. Registry Values are the data store in these Registry Keys.
A Registry Hive is a group of Keys, subkeys, and values stored in a single file on the disk.

2. Structure of the Registry
The registry on any Windows system contains the following five root keys:
    1. HKEY_CURRENT_USER
    2. HKEY_HKEY_USERS
    3. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
    4. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
    5. HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG

To see this, you press the windows key and the R key simultaneously. Then type regedit.exe, then you can
see the registry editor window.

1.HKEY_CURRENT_USER: Contains the root of the configuration information for the user who is currently logged 
on. The user's folders, screen colors, and control panel settings are stored here. This information is associated
with the user's profile. This key is somtimes abbreviated as HKCU.

2.HKEY_USERS: Contains all the actively loaded user profiles on the computer. HKEY_CURRENT_USER is a subkey of HKEY_USERS.
HKEY_USERS is sometimes abbreviated as HKU.

3.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE: Contains configuration information particular to the computer(for any user). This key is sometimes 
abbreviated as HKLM.

4.HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT: Is a subkey of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software. The information that is stored here makes sure that the correct
program opens when you open a file by using Windows Explore. This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKCR.

Starting with Windows 2000, this information is stored under both the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and HKEY_CURRENT_USER keys. The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes 
key contains default settings that can apply to all users on the local computer. The HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes key has setting that override the default
settings and apply only to the interactive user.

The HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT key provides a view of registry that merges the information from these two sources.
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT also provides this merged view for programs that are designed for earlier versions of Windows. To change the settings for the interactive user, change
must be made under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes instead of under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.

To change the default settings, change must be made under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes.
If u write keys to a key under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, the system stores the information under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes.
If you write values to a key under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, and the key already exists under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes, the system will store the information there instead of under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes

5.HKEY HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG: Contains information about the hardware profile that is used by the local computer at system startup.
